# awsctx

I spend a lot of time doing bouncing between aws accounts and I couldn't find an easy way to manage the different access keys I had. After using kubectx I was inspired to create a similar tool but for switching between different aws accounts.

## Installing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kadenbarlow/awsctx.git
cd awsctx
cp awsctx /usr/local/bin/awsctx
```

## Future Work
[ ] Integrate aescrypt so that aws creds remain encrypted at rest
